    <p><font size="5">Ravenclaw was one of four Hogwarts houses and prized students whose focus was on learning, wit and wisdom. This reflected the nature of their founder, Rowena Ravenclaw who was known to be a woman of remarkable diligence and intelligence. 
        The Ravenclaw common room was decorated with the house colours of blue and bronze along with their eagle emblem. The students were able to study hard in the rooms that were full of tables and bookcases, although if they were unable to solve the bronze knockerâ€™s riddle they couldn't get in until someone arrived who could!
        Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.
        Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue represented the sky and bronze symbolised the eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.</font></p>
