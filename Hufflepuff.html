    <p><font size="5">One of the four Hogwarts houses, Hufflepuff was founded by Helga Hufflepuff who valued hard work, patience, loyalty and fairness over any particular aptitude in any of her students. Although Hagrid may have once said, 'everyone says Hufflepuff are 
        a lot o' duffers' they were actually well known to be kind, reliable and honest. The house's colours were black and yellow and its emblem a badger. These colours decorated the walls of Hufflepuff's underground common room, which featured cosy burrow-like rooms, resembling a badger's sett.
    The emblematic animal was a badger, and yellow and black were its house colours. The Head of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.
    Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented golden wheat, while black was emblematic of fertile soil. The Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff 
    often demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.</font></p>
