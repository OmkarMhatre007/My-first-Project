    <p><font size="5">One of the four Hogwarts houses, Gryffindor was founded by Godric Gryffindor and favoured students who possessed characteristics such as courage, bravery and determination. 
        The house colours were scarlet and gold, and the emblematic animal was a lion, which decorated the walls of the Gryffindor common room. Gryffindor alumni included all seven Weasley children, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, all four Marauders and Albus Dumbledore.
         Gryffindor students embraced a long held rivalry with Slytherin house although they were largely friendly with Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination, to be Sorted into his house.
         The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House ghost.
         Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.
          The Gryffindor motto was "Forti Animo Estote", which was displayed on a stained glass window in the common room.</font></p>
